Identity Secure Chain
A blockchain-based digital identity verification system. Think of it as your secure digital ID, built with Ethereum technology and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

Features
🔐 Decentralized Identity (DID) with Ethereum keys (via ethers.js).

🔒 Private keys encrypted with password (SHA-256 + salt) and stored locally.

🔗 In-memory blockchain to simulate transactions and verification.

📸 Photo verification using live camera capture (simulation for now).

🆔 Aadhaar number simulation with OTP (always 123456 for demo).

🦊 MetaMask integration for wallet connection and transactions.

🚨 Anti-fraud system: max 3 transactions per minute.

🛡️ Transaction signing with private key validation.

Planned Improvements
Real biometric verification (AI-based face matching + liveness).

Aadhaar document scanning and real-time authenticity check.

Move to live Ethereum blockchain + smart contracts.

AES-256 encryption and key rotation for better security.

Mobile app with biometric authentication.

Why SecureID-Chain?
✅ You control your identity — not centralized servers.

✅ Blockchain-backed, tamper-proof verification.

✅ Transparent audit trail for every identity action.

✅ Interoperable with Ethereum DID standards.
